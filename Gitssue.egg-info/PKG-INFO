        Manage your issues from the command line.
        
        Features
        ========
        
        -  List the issues (also closed ones, if specified).
        -  Get issues descriptions.
        -  Get comment thread of the issue.
        -  Show tags of each issue, with its colors!
        
        Limitations
        ===========
        
        -  Just for repositories hosted on GitHub.
        -  No support for authentication.
        -  Because of the previous one, there's no support for private
           repositories.
        -  GitHub API limitation: also related to the authentication; for non
           authenticated requests, GitHub has a limit of 60 requests/hour to the
           API.
        -  No "write" operations (i.e. make a comment, open or close issues,
           etc.).
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Just with ``pip``:
        
        ``pip install gitssue``
        
        That's it! You can already execute ``gitssue`` in your shell.
